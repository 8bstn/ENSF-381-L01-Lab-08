# ENSF-381-L01-Lab-08
Welcome to the ENSF381 course lab! In this lab, we will create a Python tool that analyzes the
structure and content of web pages. Along the way, we will revisit some key Python basics while
working with BeautifulSoup, a powerful library for web scraping. You will get to extract text,
find common words, and even visualize the data you gather.
